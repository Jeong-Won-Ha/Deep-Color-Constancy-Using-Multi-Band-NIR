# Deep-Color-Constancy-Using-Multi-Band-NIR
This project is the code of [Deep Color Constancy Using Multi-Band NIR](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9980094?casa_token=XY_SNkH7JUQAAAAA:568NijTemRQHlOtIdj2sfzgJvG08e7uR9UeFMXtxlx6XtLXTjy4VNgTaAUZwSMFAw77tLO6IMg8).
This paper proposes deep a deep color constancy method that exploits multi-band NIR.
The proposed method exploits the relationship between RGB and NIR in illuminant estimation.
The proposed network consists of two subnets that learn local illuminant and its confidence weight respectively.

## How to use
You can train our network by running main.py.
